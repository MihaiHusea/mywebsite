          <h3>Programming and software testing</h3>
          <p class>I always been interested in IT and tech , so recently I have decided to start learning to code in Python, by taking a software testing course and "100 days of code" challenge. I know that it's a long road but with work and dedication nothing it's impossible. So, I would say my current experience it's about Python programming and software testing and a little bit of html and css. And let's not forget , "I use Linux btw. &#128521 " </p>
