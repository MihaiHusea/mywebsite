          <h3>Programming and software testing</h3>
          <p class>I have always been interested in IT and tech, so I have decided to start learning to code in Python, by taking a software testing course
              and "100 days of code" challenge. I know that it's a long road but with work and dedication it can be done. So, I would say my current 
              experience it's about Python programming and software testing and a bit of HTML and CSS. Also , "I use Linux btw.."&#128521 I'm learning by using. </p>

          <h3>Quality control</h3>
          <p>For a while, I have been working in Quality Assurance filed in industry, I have gain a lot of experience in this area. One of the jobs that I 
              had, and growth my interests about coding was in 3D measuring and programming when I have developed my skills about 3D and 2D programming. 
              One of the reason I wanted to explore coding.. </p>
